This project is modular and consists of four files: classification_analysis.py, clustering_analysis.py, exploratory_data_analysis.py, and regression_analysis.py. Each file contains code related to its respective analysis type. For example, classification_analysis.py contains code related to machine learning classifiers, while clustering_analysis.py contains code related to unsupervised learning algorithms like KMeans. The exploratory_data_analysis.py file contains code related to data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, while regression_analysis.py contains code related to regression modeling.

All these files are tied together by main.py, which imports the necessary functions from each of the other files and executes them in a specific order to generate the final results. This modular approach makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase, and also makes it more scalable to different datasets and analysis types.
